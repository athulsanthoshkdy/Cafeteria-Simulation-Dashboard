Customers arrive randomly (30 ± 20 sec), then choose between the sandwich (40%) or main counter (60%) with variable service times. After paying (25 ± 10 sec), they eat (20 ± 10 min). 10% may have dessert (10 ± 2 min). Simulation stops when 100 people leave; remaining are either eating, waiting for dessert, or finished.
